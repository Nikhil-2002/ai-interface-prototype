# Complete Setup & Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these exact steps to deploy your AI Interface Prototype:

### Step 1: Prepare for GitHub

First, let's build and test your project locally:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd D:\Assignments\predusk

# Build the project to ensure everything works
npm run build

# Test the build locally (optional)
npx serve -s build
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - Repository name: `ai-interface-prototype`
   - Description: `A modern, responsive AI chat interface built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS`
   - Visibility: **Public** (required for free Netlify)
   - ‚ùå Don't check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 3: Upload Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Interface Prototype with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin (REPLACE yourusername with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interface-prototype.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and create account/sign in
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Choose "GitHub"** as your Git provider
4. **Authorize Netlify** to access your repositories
5. **Select your `ai-interface-prototype` repository**
6. **Configure build settings:**
   - Branch to deploy: `main`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
7. **Click "Deploy site"**
8. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)
9. **Get your live URL** (something like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`)

#### Option B: Quick Deploy (Drag & Drop)

```bash
# Build your project
npm run build

# Go to Netlify.com
# Drag and drop your 'build' folder to the deployment area
# Get instant deployment!
```

### Step 5: Update URLs and Metadata

After successful deployment, update these files with your actual URLs:

#### Update package.json
```bash
# Edit package.json and replace:
"homepage": "https://your-actual-netlify-url.netlify.app"
"repository": {
  "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interface-prototype.git"
}
"author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

#### Update README.md
```bash
# Edit README.md and replace:
**Live URL:** https://your-actual-netlify-url.netlify.app
```

### Step 6: Create Figma Design (Required)

1. **Go to [Figma.com](https://figma.com)** and create free account
2. **Create new design file** named "AI Interface Prototype Mockup"
3. **Take screenshots** of your running app (see `docs/DESIGN.md` for detailed guide)
4. **Create mockups** based on your screenshots
5. **Share the Figma file** publicly
6. **Update README.md** with Figma link

### Step 7: Deploy Storybook (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Build Storybook
npm run build-storybook

# Deploy storybook-static folder as a separate Netlify site
# Name it something like "ai-interface-storybook"
```

## üìã Final Checklist

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify
```bash
# Check your build locally first
npm run build

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
# 2. Check for TypeScript errors
# 3. Verify no console.log or unused imports
```

### Site Doesn't Load
```bash
# Check these:
# 1. Verify build directory is 'build'
# 2. Check browser console for errors
# 3. Ensure all assets are properly referenced
```
